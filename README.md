Multisite Language Switcher Theme
=================================

About
-----

This Theme is a hack for multilingual blog using **multisite wordpress**. It redirect users from "/" to "/en/" or "/fr/" in function of the accepted languages of the browser.
The Theme redirect the 404 error page too.

This theme is a quick and dirty hack for my previous multilingual blog [(http://oncleben31.cc)](http://oncleben31.cc). I've switched from Wordpress to Jekyll so I won't update it anymore (I think I never updated it ;-)
Don't hesitate to fork and improve it.

This theme is a good companion to [Multisite Language Switcher (by lloc)](https://github.com/lloc/Multisite-Language-Switcher) plugin for Wordpress. I've develop a similar plugin few years ago but this one is far more mature. Give it a try

Set-up Instructions
-------------------

Prerequisite: Your Wordpress installtion should use a network and a dedicated folder for each language ('/fr' and '/en' in my case). 
* Install this theme on your network
* use this theme for the root blog (which is useless if your are compliant with prerequisites )
* Hack it if you have some specificities.

old TODO list. I won't work on it:
----
* use theme option to set the languages and redirect adresses
* don't use only the prefered language ($Langue[0]), use the others.
* add an ignore list for (robot.txt or sitemap file generated by plugin or wordpress)
